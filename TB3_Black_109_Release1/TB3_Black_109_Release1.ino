111 Target - Aux Distance with ability for continuous loop - shorten lean.
Add Stopmotion to Inshot menu
Add Brightness to in shot menu

109 Release Notes

-Fixed Aux reverse to work in all cases
-Added ability to reverse AUX_REV to EEPROM direction.
-Added interval change functionality to in shot menu - don't recommend this is used ever unless your shot is already ruined.  Changing anything mid shot will show.
-Added functionality to use left right to set frame to go to.  Can go forward or back.
-Relaxed tight requirements for joystick absolute centering - check
-Fixed motor feedrate issue when Static Time was maxed out.  If you are maxing out your static time by default, you are not using this setting correctly and hurting your shot!  
-Made Static time a max of Interval minus 0.3 seconds to allow at least a .15 second move - check
-Added abs on feedrate min calc to accommodate spurious overrun negatives on SMS shoots resulting in single long frame delays
-Added check on minimum for video to ensure we don't catch 3PT video moves on min calc.
-Added test against power policy for loop 52 (ext triggering)  
-Added ramping and new motor move to starts and ends (decoupled inputs)
-Added coordinated return to start and three axis moves.
-Updated the motorMoving to accurately assign this
-Broke up move profiles.  Added slow down routine to the move to start/move to end.
-Throttled the calc of the move to respect max jog speeds by axis.  If we hit this we indicates "Speed Limit" on video run screen.  If you hit this, lengthen move and/or decrease ramp
-Added to the Setup Menu the Motor Speed parameter - from 2000 to 20000 max to allow folks to tune.the speeds for AUX.  Pan and Tilt are hardcoded.
-Start delay cleaned up and fixed - now down to the second - also a bailout of CZ to get to 5 seconds so you aren't stuck with accidental long delays
-Add Going to End LCD prompt if heading there.
-Target, Go To End. This now works
-Focus on return to start method.  Pause parameters improved to prevent toggling - added CZ released to check for long holds and released.
-Added new Tab for TB3_InShootMenu - just pauses now and only from progstep 50 (regular SMS)
-Added return to start - just called the same routine from the repeat move at the end of the shot - finds start fine (0's) not sure

/*Power Save explanation
We can power up and power down the Pan Tilt motors together.  We can power up and power down the Aux motor port as well.  We see three levels of power saving:
1)  None - Motors are always on - for VFX work where power isn't a factor and precision is most important.  Motors will get warm here on hot days.
2)  Low - only at the end of program 
3)  Standard - Power up the motors for the shooting time (all the time we hold the trigger down), and move, power down between shots.
4)  High - Only power on for motor moves, turn off the motors when we reach the shooting position.  
    We are powered down for the shot and only power on for moves. This saves a ton of battery for long astro shots.   
    We do lose microstep resolution for this, but it usually is not visible.   We could be off by as much as 8/16 mircosetps for a shot or 0.018 degrees - Really small stuff!  Try this mode out!
